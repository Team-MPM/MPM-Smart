## The idea

Creating a fully wireless smart-home / IOT automation system with a central 
management controller. We implement an open standard built on plugins and an
extensible architecture. The entire Project is fully open source and contributions
from the community are highly welcome. We collect metrics and telemetry from
multiple sources and display them in custom configurable dashboards. We also plan
to support actor devices than can be controlled via the dashboard in real time
or automatically controlled via dynamic workflows.
